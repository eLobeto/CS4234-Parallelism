But
I

His
thoughts
trailed
off
as
he
passed
out
and
his
head
fell
to
the
desk.

	Caleb
glanced
back
in
the
rearview
mirror
trying
to
identify
the
men
in
the
blacked
out
BMW
behind
him.
All
he
saw
when
he
looked
back
was
two
men,
pretty
bulky
by
his
standards,
in
all-white
suits
and
black
sunglasses.
They
were
unidentifiable.
One
of
them
appeared
to
be
holding
an
assault
rifle;
he
didnt
know
much
about
guns
but
it
didnt
look
like
anything
he
had
seen
in
movies
or
on
TV.
These
guys
must
be
pretty
serious,
he
thought
as
he
swung
the
car
around
the
next
corner.
He
first
noticed
the
car
following
him
a
few
blocks
after
he
left
from
work
in
DC
and
figured
it
must
have
just
been
a
coincidence.
It
was
only
after
several
minutes
and
noticing
the
car
follow
him
turn
for
turn
always
exactly
three
cars
behind
him
that
he
realized
something
was
wrong.
Why
were
these
men
following
him
though?
What
had
he
done?
Caleb
thought
back
through
the
past
week
and
tried
to
come
up
with
anything
he
could
have
done
to
warrant
the
obviously
professional
hit
men
that
were
chasing
him.
Nothing
came
to
mind,
after
a
ll
there
wasnt
much
he
could
have
gotten
in
to.
He
was
just
a
mid-level
government
worker
at
the
FBI
building.
He
wasnt
even
officially
part
of
the
FBI;
he
was
only
a
GS-8
working
nine
to
five
just
to
pay
rent
in
his
Alexandria
townhouse.
As
Caleb
checked
back
in
his
rearview
mirror
again
the
car
tailing
him
appeared
to
be
gone.
Breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
he
checked
all
around
the
car.
His
stomach
dropped
as
soon
as
he
looked
over
out
of
the
passenger
window.
The
black
car
was
pulled
up
even
with
him
with
its
window
rolled
down
and
the
passenger
had
his
rifle
leveled
at
him.

	Why
werent
your
men
able
to
stay
hidden?
the
man
raged.
It
was
a
simple
enough
task,
all
they
had
to
do
was
trail
this
nobody
for
a
few
days
and
monitor
his
activity!
He
slammed
his
fist
down
on
the
table.


	Were
sorry,
sir,
apologized
the
other
man,
glancing
over
at
his
partner.
Well
make
sure
everything
is
handled
appropriately.

	How
can
anything
be
handled
like
this?
the
first
man
questioned
as
he
gestured
towards
the
view
screens
displaying
footage
from
the
traffic
cams.
The
hit
men
had
pulled
up
next
to
Caleb
and
the
men
in
the
room
could
see
the
faint
view
of
a
muzzle
pointed
out
of
the
window.
How
is
anything
going
to
be
handled
if
this
man
ends
up
dead?

	Caleb
searched
frantically
for
somewhere
he
could
go
to
escape
what
was
certainly
going
to
happen.
He
slammed
on
his
brakes
and
the
BMW
flew
past
him
and
he
could
see
the
man
with
the
gun
turn
around
in
his
seat
to
watch
where
he
went
next.
Caleb
pushed
the
pedal
to
the
floor
and
cut
across
3
lanes
of
traffic
to
reach
the
exit.
Drivers
honked
their
horns
angrily
as
he
drove
down
the
exit
and
slid
around
the
next
turn
running
the
red
light.
He
couldnt
go
back
to
his
house
now;
hed
seen
too
many
movies
and
knew
that
the
men
could
be
setting
an
ambush
for
him.
He
pulled
into
a
grocery
store
parking
lot
to
catch
his
breath
and
figure
out
what
he
would
do
next.
If
he
checked
into
a
hotel
his
card
could
be
traced
and
he
didnt
have
enough
cash
in
his
wallet
for
a
room.
He
pulled
out
his
phone
and
checked
his
contacts;
maybe
one
of
his
friends
could
lend
him
a
spare
room
for
a
night
or
two.
He
picked
a
co-worker
and
dialed
the
number
and
listened
to
the
ring.


	Hello?
came
the
voice
on
the
other
end
of
the
line.

	Connor?
Hey
its
Caleb,
I
need
a
favor
from
you,
Caleb
blurted
out.

	Yeah,
sure
thing,
what
do
you
need?

Its
a
long
story
to
explain
right
now,
but
I
need
to
stay
at
your
place
for
a
few
days.

	Yeah,
definitely,
thats
not
a
problem
at
all.
Just
come
on
over,
Ill
be
here,
Connor
said.

	Caleb
hung
up
the
phone
and
sat
back
in
his
seat
and
took
a
deep
breath.
He
needed
to
keep
his
wits
about
him
in
order
to
stay
safe
and
keep
whoever
was
chasing
him
unaware
of
his
location.
He
turned
the
key
in
the
ignition
and
pulled
out
onto
the
street,
wary
of
any
suspicious
looking
cars.
None
were
to
be
seen
so
he
continued
over
to
Connors
house.
As
he
turned
onto
the
street
where
Connor
lived,
he
saw
a
trio
of
black-suited
men
turning
the
corner
the
next
street
down.
How
had
they
known
where
he
was
going
to
go?
He
parked
his
car
a
few
houses
down
from
Connors
and
walked
the
rest
of
the
way.
His
knock
was
greeted
by
Connors
large
smile
and
barking
German
Shepard.

	Is
everything
alright?
Connor
questioned.

	Im
not
sure,
some
really
weird
things
have
been
happening,
Caleb
said
warily,
not
wanting
to
tip
off
Connor
to
all
the
details
in
case
he
was
somehow
involved.


	Weve
tracked
his
location,
sir,
said
the
man,
a
note
of
relief
creeping
into
his
voice.
He
did
not
want
to
suffer
the
punishment
if
they
had
allowed
Caleb
to
escape.
It
seems
he
is
at
one
Connor
Hardins
house,
address
1452
Frostleaf
Drive.

	Perfect,
came
the
response.
I
want
men
stationed
at
every
street
corner
monitoring
his
every
move.
If
he
leaves
the
area,
I
want
to
know
about
it
before
it
happens.

	Will
do,
sir.
Why
is
this
man
so
important?
he
wondered;
all
he
did
was
work
a
simple
desk
job
at
the
FBI
building.
He
couldnt
possibly
know
anything
of
value,
but
who
was
he
to
judge?
If
the
Duke
wanted
him
watched
and
captured
then
that
is
what
he
would
do,
money
was
money.

	So
youre
saying
youve
been
chased
since
you
left
work
today?
Connor
asked
incredulously.
But
why?
What
could
they
want
with
you,
its
not
like
youre
a
spy
or
anyone
important,
no
offense,
you
just
work
at
a
desk.

	Yeah
I
know
thats
what
Ive
been
trying
to
figure
out.
Caleb
had
asked
Connor
a
few
questions
and
had
assuaged
his
worries
about
his
involvement.
And
to
make
everything
worse,
I
saw
a
group
of
men
walking
around
the
corner
a
street
down
from
here.
They
were
all
wearing
black
suits.
I
think
they
might
know
Im
here;
I
cant
stay
for
long.
I
dont
want
to
get
you
involved
too.

	At
least
have
some
food
before
you
head
out,
Connor
insisted.


	I
cant,
Caleb
said
with
a
wry
smile,
I
need
to
keep
moving,
I
cant
let
them
pin
me
down
to
one
location.
How
did
he
know
this?
Before
when
the
men
were
chasing
him,
he
had
attributed
his
knowledge
of
what
to
do
to
movies
hed
watched,
but
this
was
starting
to
get
weird.
It
was
almost
instinct
now;
he
hadnt
hesitated
in
turning
down
Connors
offer
of
food.

	Caleb
left
out
of
the
back
door
of
Connors
house,
climbed
the
fence
and
hurried
across
the
lawn
over
to
the
next
street.
The
cab
he
had
dialed
before
he
left
Connors
was
waiting
for
him
as
promised
and
he
jumped
into
the
back
seat
and
gave
the
cabdriver
the
address
of
the
FBI
building
back
in
DC.
He
couldnt
take
his
car
because
they
might
have
been
monitoring
it,
he
couldnt
leave
through
the
front
door
because
they
would
probably
be
watching
that
too
and
the
backyard
was
obscured
by
tall
pines
that
would
conceal
him.
The
same
question
rose
into
his
consciousness
again:
how
did
he
know
to
do
these
things?
He
was
sure
any
normal
person
wouldnt
have
thought
to
take
those
extra
precautions.
He
needed
to
get
back
to
the
FBI
office
and
figure
out
what
was
going
on.

	Sir,
we
saw
a
cab
leave
the
neighborhood
a
few
minutes
ago.
We
didnt
see
anyone
leave
the
Hardin
house,
but
the
men
on
the
ground
say
they
dont
see
the
target
in
the
house
anymore.

	I
thought
I
told
you
I
wanted
to
know
if
he
moved
BEFORE
he
moved?
the
Duke
roared.
These
men
were
so
incompetent.
All
they
had
to
do
was
watch
a
house
and
report
to
him
if
the
target
left,
as
soon
as
he
left.


	Were
sorry
sir,
he
must
have
suspected
we
knew
where
he
was
and
slipped
out
of
the
back.
We
have
eyes
on
the
taxi
now
though,
he
wont
outsmart
us
again.

	He
already
outsmarted
you
one
time
too
many,
thought
the
Duke.
He
wasnt
supposed
to
be
this
prepared;
he
wasnt
supposed
to
remember
any
of
his
training.
If
he
was
smart
enough
to
take
a
taxi
rather
than
his
own
vehicle,
sneak
out
of
the
back,
and
elude
his
men
on
the
highway
this
clearly
was
not
the
case.
How
much
did
he
know?

	Caleb
was
hoping
the
FBI
building
was
the
last
place
the
mysterious
men
would
look
for
him.
After
all,
what
sane
people
would
try
to
apprehend
someone
in
a
federal
building,
much
less
in
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation?
Unless
these
men
were
working
for
them.
The
thought
chilled
him
to
the
core.
He
pushed
it
out
of
his
head
and
swiped
into
the
building.
The
first
thing
that
struck
him
as
being
odd
was
the
lack
of
people.
Usually
there
were
several
receptionists
working
at
the
front
desk
twenty-four
seven.
He
shrugged
it
off
and
walked
over
to
the
bank
of
elevators
and
pressed
the
call
button.
As
he
waited
for
the
elevator
to
arrive
he
looked
around
the
first
floor
and
began
to
notice
more
strange
things.
It
didnt
seem
that
the
receptionists
simply
werent
working;
it
more
seemed
that
they
had
left
in
a
rush.
The
chairs
werent
pushed
in
neatly;
they
were
left
at
awkward
distances
from
the
desks
like
someone
had
pushed
them
back
from
the
desk
in
a
hasty
attempt
to
leave.
The
computers
were
also
on
with
the
ir
lock
screens
showing.
If
they
had
indeed
left
for
the
night,
they
would
have
been
shut
off.
Something
was
definitely
wrong
here.
He
was
interrupted
from
his
reverie
by
the
rude
sound
of
the
arrival
of
the
elevator.
Cautiously
he
stepped
inside
and
pressed
the
button
for
the
17th
floor
where
his
cubicle
was
located.
As
the
elevator
climbed
higher
and
higher
up
the
feeling
of
dread
grew
exponentially
within
him
as
he
passed
each
floor.
The
chime
signaled
that
Caleb
had
reached
his
destination
and
the
doors
opened.


	Sir,
the
elevator
has
reached
the
seventeenth
floor,
the
man
announced.
What
should
I
have
the
men
do?

	Hold
them
in
position,
and
DONT
let
them
be
seen.
I
want
him
to
think
hes
alone,
Im
curious
to
see
what
hell
do,
instructed
the
Duke.
What
did
he
hope
to
find
in
his
cubicle?
He
highly
doubted
that
there
was
anything
of
significant
importance.

	Yes
sir,
the
men
are
holding
in
position.

	As
Caleb
stepped
out
of
the
elevator
his
sense
of
paranoia
grew
stronger.
The
whole
floor
appeared
to
be
empty.
There
were
usually
a
few
people
who
stayed
late
working
but
tonight
there
wasnt
anyone
to
be
found.
To
top
everything
off,
the
lights
were
all
turned
off
too.
The
lights
were
never
off,
even
in
a
power
outage
a
group
of
emergency
generators
kicked
on
to
provide
power.
The
only
way
the
lights
would
ever
be
off
is
if
someone
manually
turned
them
off
which
was
incredibly
rare.


	Caleb
walked
over
to
the
room
where
the
breaker
board
was
and
turned
the
knob.
Unlocked.
This
door
was
never
unlocked,
not
unless
maintenance
was
doing
work,
but
it
was
well
past
the
time
that
they
would
be
doing
anything.
Warily
Caleb
opened
the
door
and
peered
inside.
He
didnt
see
anyone
so
he
stepped
inside
and
flipped
the
breakers
back
on.
He
watched
the
space
outside
as
each
bank
of
fluorescent
lights
flicked
on
one
by
one.
As
he
was
looking
across
towards
the
far
side
of
the
room
he
saw
a
dark
figure
dart
into
one
of
the
cubicles.
He
suspected
it
all
along;
the
men
had
followed
him
here
and
set
a
trap
to
catch
him.


	He
sprinted
out
of
the
electric
room
and
ran
to
the
stairs.
He
couldnt
take
the
elevator;
the
men
would
surely
catch
him
as
he
waited
for
it
to
arrive.
He
burst
through
the
stairwell
door
and
pounded
down
the
stairs
two
at
a
time.
Before
he
realized
it
he
was
already
down
to
the
twelfth
floor.
He
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
and
looked
up
the
stairwell
above
him.
Seeing
nothing
he
craned
his
ears
listening
for
any
sound
that
the
men
would
be
following
him.
Still,
nothing.
He
continued
to
rest
for
a
few
more
seconds
but
stepped
inside
to
the
twelfth
floor
just
in
case
the
men
were
chasing
him.

	Sir,
he
just
ran
down
the
stairs.
Were
not
sure
where
he
went
since
there
are
no
cameras
in
the
stairwell,
the
man
said
hesitantly,
flinching
in
expectance
of
the
rage
to
come.

	WHY
CAN
YOU
GUYS
NOT
DO
A
SINGLE
THING
RIGHT?
exclaimed
the
Duke.
All
your
men
had
to
do
was
STAY
STILL!
How
hard
can
that
be?
Apparently
very
hard,
he
concluded,
answering
his
own
question.
This
was
a
waste
of
time,
he
had
been
assigned
a
terrible
team
of
men
and
it
seemed
that
Caleb
was
remembering
more
than
he
was
supposed
to.
He
reached
over
to
a
button
on
the
side
of
his
desk.

	As
Caleb
rested
in
one
of
the
desk
chairs
contemplating
his
next
move,
a
blaring
klaxon
sounded
throughout
the
building
and
red
alarm
lights
started
flashing.
What
did
they
do
now?
Pull
the
fire
alarm
to
flush
me
out?
Im
not
going
out
that
easily,
he
thought.
Suddenly
his
vision
clouded
and
felt
a
sharp
pain
coming
from
the
back
of
his
head.
Nerve
agents
now?
But
I
saw
no
gas
His
thoughts
trailed
off
as
he
passed
out
and
his
head
fell
to
the
desk.

	





	Caleb
glanced
back
in
the
rearview
mirror
trying
to
identify
the
men
in
the
blacked
out
BMW
behind
him.
All
he
saw
when
he
looked
back
was
two
men,
pretty
bulky
by
his
standards,
in
all-white
suits
and
black
sunglasses.
They
were
unidentifiable.
One
of
them
appeared
to
be
holding
an
assault
rifle;
he
didnt
know
much
about
guns
but
it
didnt
look
like
anything
he
had
seen
in
movies
or
on
TV.
These
guys
must
be
pretty
serious,
he
thought
as
he
swung
the
car
around
the
next
corner.
He
first
noticed
the
car
following
him
a
few
blocks
after
he
left
from
work
in
DC
and
figured
it
must
have
just
been
a
coincidence.
It
was
only
after
several
minutes
and
noticing
the
car
follow
him
turn
for
turn
always
exactly
three
cars
behind
him
that
he
realized
something
was
wrong.
Why
were
these
men
following
him
though?
What
had
he
done?
Caleb
thought
back
through
the
past
week
and
tried
to
come
up
with
anything
he
could
have
done
to
warrant
the
obviously
professional
hit
men
that
were
chasing
him.
Nothing
came
to
mind,
after
a
ll
there
wasnt
much
he
could
have
gotten
in
to.
He
was
just
a
mid-level
government
worker
at
the
FBI
building.
He
wasnt
even
officially
part
of
the
FBI;
he
was
only
a
GS-8
working
nine
to
five
just
to
pay
rent
in
his
Alexandria
townhouse.
As
Caleb
checked
back
in
his
rearview
mirror
again
the
car
tailing
him
appeared
to
be
gone.
Breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
he
checked
all
around
the
car.
His
stomach
dropped
as
soon
as
he
looked
over
out
of
the
passenger
window.
The
black
car
was
pulled
up
even
with
him
with
its
window
rolled
down
and
the
passenger
had
his
rifle
leveled
at
him.

	Why
werent
your
men
able
to
stay
hidden?
the
man
raged.
It
was
a
simple
enough
task,
all
they
had
to
do
was
trail
this
nobody
for
a
few
days
and
monitor
his
activity!
He
slammed
his
fist
down
on
the
table.


	Were
sorry,
sir,
apologized
the
other
man,
glancing
over
at
his
partner.
Well
make
sure
everything
is
handled
appropriately.

	How
can
anything
be
handled
like
this?
the
first
man
questioned
as
he
gestured
towards
the
view
screens
displaying
footage
from
the
traffic
cams.
The
hit
men
had
pulled
up
next
to
Caleb
and
the
men
in
the
room
could
see
the
faint
view
of
a
muzzle
pointed
out
of
the
window.
How
is
anything
going
to
be
handled
if
this
man
ends
up
dead?

	Caleb
searched
frantically
for
somewhere
he
could
go
to
escape
what
was
certainly
going
to
happen.
He
slammed
on
his
brakes
and
the
BMW
flew
past
him
and
he
could
see
the
man
with
the
gun
turn
around
in
his
seat
to
watch
where
he
went
next.
Caleb
pushed
the
pedal
to
the
floor
and
cut
across
3
lanes
of
traffic
to
reach
the
exit.
Drivers
honked
their
horns
angrily
as
he
drove
down
the
exit
and
slid
around
the
next
turn
running
the
red
light.
He
couldnt
go
back
to
his
house
now;
hed
seen
too
many
movies
and
knew
that
the
men
could
be
setting
an
ambush
for
him.
He
pulled
into
a
grocery
store
parking
lot
to
catch
his
breath
and
figure
out
what
he
would
do
next.
If
he
checked
into
a
hotel
his
card
could
be
traced
and
he
didnt
have
enough
cash
in
his
wallet
for
a
room.
He
pulled
out
his
phone
and
checked
his
contacts;
maybe
one
of
his
friends
could
lend
him
a
spare
room
for
a
night
or
two.
He
picked
a
co-worker
and
dialed
the
number
and
listened
to
the
ring.


	Hello?
came
the
voice
on
the
other
end
of
the
line.

	Connor?
Hey
its
Caleb,
I
need
a
favor
from
you,
Caleb
blurted
out.

	Yeah,
sure
thing,
what
do
you
need?

Its
a
long
story
to
explain
right
now,
but
I
need
to
stay
at
your
place
for
a
few
days.

	Yeah,
definitely,
thats
not
a
problem
at
all.
Just
come
on
over,
Ill
be
here,
Connor
said.

	Caleb
hung
up
the
phone
and
sat
back
in
his
seat
and
took
a
deep
breath.
He
needed
to
keep
his
wits
about
him
in
order
to
stay
safe
and
keep
whoever
was
chasing
him
unaware
of
his
location.
He
turned
the
key
in
the
ignition
and
pulled
out
onto
the
street,
wary
of
any
suspicious
looking
cars.
None
were
to
be
seen
so
he
continued
over
to
Connors
house.
As
he
turned
onto
the
street
where
Connor
lived,
he
saw
a
trio
of
black-suited
men
turning
the
corner
the
next
street
down.
How
had
they
known
where
he
was
going
to
go?
He
parked
his
car
a
few
houses
down
from
Connors
and
walked
the
rest
of
the
way.
His
knock
was
greeted
by
Connors
large
smile
and
barking
German
Shepard.

	Is
everything
alright?
Connor
questioned.

	Im
not
sure,
some
really
weird
things
have
been
happening,
Caleb
said
warily,
not
wanting
to
tip
off
Connor
to
all
the
details
in
case
he
was
somehow
involved.


	Weve
tracked
his
location,
sir,
said
the
man,
a
note
of
relief
creeping
into
his
voice.
He
did
not
want
to
suffer
the
punishment
if
they
had
allowed
Caleb
to
escape.
It
seems
he
is
at
one
Connor
Hardins
house,
address
1452
Frostleaf
Drive.

	Perfect,
came
the
response.
I
want
men
stationed
at
every
street
corner
monitoring
his
every
move.
If
he
leaves
the
area,
I
want
to
know
about
it
before
it
happens.

	Will
do,
sir.
Why
is
this
man
so
important?
he
wondered;
all
he
did
was
work
a
simple
desk
job
at
the
FBI
building.
He
couldnt
possibly
know
anything
of
value,
but
who
was
he
to
judge?
If
the
Duke
wanted
him
watched
and
captured
then
that
is
what
he
would
do,
money
was
money.

	So
youre
saying
youve
been
chased
since
you
left
work
today?
Connor
asked
incredulously.
But
why?
What
could
they
want
with
you,
its
not
like
youre
a
spy
or
anyone
important,
no
offense,
you
just
work
at
a
desk.

	Yeah
I
know
thats
what
Ive
been
trying
to
figure
out.
Caleb
had
asked
Connor
a
few
questions
and
had
assuaged
his
worries
about
his
involvement.
And
to
make
everything
worse,
I
saw
a
group
of
men
walking
around
the
corner
a
street
down
from
here.
They
were
all
wearing
black
suits.
I
think
they
might
know
Im
here;
I
cant
stay
for
long.
I
dont
want
to
get
you
involved
too.

	At
least
have
some
food
before
you
head
out,
Connor
insisted.


	I
cant,
Caleb
said
with
a
wry
smile,
I
need
to
keep
moving,
I
cant
let
them
pin
me
down
to
one
location.
How
did
he
know
this?
Before
when
the
men
were
chasing
him,
he
had
attributed
his
knowledge
of
what
to
do
to
movies
hed
watched,
but
this
was
starting
to
get
weird.
It
was
almost
instinct
now;
he
hadnt
hesitated
in
turning
down
Connors
offer
of
food.

	Caleb
left
out
of
the
back
door
of
Connors
house,
climbed
the
fence
and
hurried
across
the
lawn
over
to
the
next
street.
The
cab
he
had
dialed
before
he
left
Connors
was
waiting
for
him
as
promised
and
he
jumped
into
the
back
seat
and
gave
the
cabdriver
the
address
of
the
FBI
building
back
in
DC.
He
couldnt
take
his
car
because
they
might
have
been
monitoring
it,
he
couldnt
leave
through
the
front
door
because
they
would
probably
be
watching
that
too
and
the
backyard
was
obscured
by
tall
pines
that
would
conceal
him.
The
same
question
rose
into
his
consciousness
again:
how
did
he
know
to
do
these
things?
He
was
sure
any
normal
person
wouldnt
have
thought
to
take
those
extra
precautions.
He
needed
to
get
back
to
the
FBI
office
and
figure
out
what
was
going
on.

	Sir,
we
saw
a
cab
leave
the
neighborhood
a
few
minutes
ago.
We
didnt
see
anyone
leave
the
Hardin
house,
but
the
men
on
the
ground
say
they
dont
see
the
target
in
the
house
anymore.

	I
thought
I
told
you
I
wanted
to
know
if
he
moved
BEFORE
he
moved?
the
Duke
roared.
These
men
were
so
incompetent.
All
they
had
to
do
was
watch
a
house
and
report
to
him
if
the
target
left,
as
soon
as
he
left.


	Were
sorry
sir,
he
must
have
suspected
we
knew
where
he
was
and
slipped
out
of
the
back.
We
have
eyes
on
the
taxi
now
though,
he
wont
outsmart
us
again.

	He
already
outsmarted
you
one
time
too
many,
thought
the
Duke.
He
wasnt
supposed
to
be
this
prepared;
he
wasnt
supposed
to
remember
any
of
his
training.
If
he
was
smart
enough
to
take
a
taxi
rather
than
his
own
vehicle,
sneak
out
of
the
back,
and
elude
his
men
on
the
highway
this
clearly
was
not
the
case.
How
much
did
he
know?

	Caleb
was
hoping
the
FBI
building
was
the
last
place
the
mysterious
men
would
look
for
him.
After
all,
what
sane
people
would
try
to
apprehend
someone
in
a
federal
building,
much
less
in
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation?
Unless
these
men
were
working
for
them.
The
thought
chilled
him
to
the
core.
He
pushed
it
out
of
his
head
and
swiped
into
the
building.
The
first
thing
that
struck
him
as
being
odd
was
the
lack
of
people.
Usually
there
were
several
receptionists
working
at
the
front
desk
twenty-four
seven.
He
shrugged
it
off
and
walked
over
to
the
bank
of
elevators
and
pressed
the
call
button.
As
he
waited
for
the
elevator
to
arrive
he
looked
around
the
first
floor
and
began
to
notice
more
strange
things.
It
didnt
seem
that
the
receptionists
simply
werent
working;
it
more
seemed
that
they
had
left
in
a
rush.
The
chairs
werent
pushed
in
neatly;
they
were
left
at
awkward
distances
from
the
desks
like
someone
had
pushed
them
back
from
the
desk
in
a
hasty
attempt
to
leave.
The
computers
were
also
on
with
the
ir
lock
screens
showing.
If
they
had
indeed
left
for
the
night,
they
would
have
been
shut
off.
Something
was
definitely
wrong
here.
He
was
interrupted
from
his
reverie
by
the
rude
sound
of
the
arrival
of
the
elevator.
Cautiously
he
stepped
inside
and
pressed
the
button
for
the
17th
floor
where
his
cubicle
was
located.
As
the
elevator
climbed
higher
and
higher
up
the
feeling
of
dread
grew
exponentially
within
him
as
he
passed
each
floor.
The
chime
signaled
that
Caleb
had
reached
his
destination
and
the
doors
opened.


	Sir,
the
elevator
has
reached
the
seventeenth
floor,
the
man
announced.
What
should
I
have
the
men
do?

	Hold
them
in
position,
and
DONT
let
them
be
seen.
I
want
him
to
think
hes
alone,
Im
curious
to
see
what
hell
do,
instructed
the
Duke.
What
did
he
hope
to
find
in
his
cubicle?
He
highly
doubted
that
there
was
anything
of
significant
importance.

	Yes
sir,
the
men
are
holding
in
position.

	As
Caleb
stepped
out
of
the
elevator
his
sense
of
paranoia
grew
stronger.
The
whole
floor
appeared
to
be
empty.
There
were
usually
a
few
people
who
stayed
late
working
but
tonight
there
wasnt
anyone
to
be
found.
To
top
everything
off,
the
lights
were
all
turned
off
too.
The
lights
were
never
off,
even
in
a
power
outage
a
group
of
emergency
generators
kicked
on
to
provide
power.
The
only
way
the
lights
would
ever
be
off
is
if
someone
manually
turned
them
off
which
was
incredibly
rare.


	Caleb
walked
over
to
the
room
where
the
breaker
board
was
and
turned
the
knob.
Unlocked.
This
door
was
never
unlocked,
not
unless
maintenance
was
doing
work,
but
it
was
well
past
the
time
that
they
would
be
doing
anything.
Warily
Caleb
opened
the
door
and
peered
inside.
He
didnt
see
anyone
so
he
stepped
inside
and
flipped
the
breakers
back
on.
He
watched
the
space
outside
as
each
bank
of
fluorescent
lights
flicked
on
one
by
one.
As
he
was
looking
across
towards
the
far
side
of
the
room
he
saw
a
dark
figure
dart
into
one
of
the
cubicles.
He
suspected
it
all
along;
the
men
had
followed
him
here
and
set
a
trap
to
catch
him.


	He
sprinted
out
of
the
electric
room
and
ran
to
the
stairs.
He
couldnt
take
the
elevator;
the
men
would
surely
catch
him
as
he
waited
for
it
to
arrive.
He
burst
through
the
stairwell
door
and
pounded
down
the
stairs
two
at
a
time.
Before
he
realized
it
he
was
already
down
to
the
twelfth
floor.
He
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
and
looked
up
the
stairwell
above
him.
Seeing
nothing
he
craned
his
ears
listening
for
any
sound
that
the
men
would
be
following
him.
Still,
nothing.
He
continued
to
rest
for
a
few
more
seconds
but
stepped
inside
to
the
twelfth
floor
just
in
case
the
men
were
chasing
him.

	Sir,
he
just
ran
down
the
stairs.
Were
not
sure
where
he
went
since
there
are
no
cameras
in
the
stairwell,
the
man
said
hesitantly,
flinching
in
expectance
of
the
rage
to
come.

	WHY
CAN
YOU
GUYS
NOT
DO
A
SINGLE
THING
RIGHT?
exclaimed
the
Duke.
All
your
men
had
to
do
was
STAY
STILL!
How
hard
can
that
be?
Apparently
very
hard,
he
concluded,
answering
his
own
question.
This
was
a
waste
of
time,
he
had
been
assigned
a
terrible
team
of
men
and
it
seemed
that
Caleb
was
remembering
more
than
he
was
supposed
to.
He
reached
over
to
a
button
on
the
side
of
his
desk.

	As
Caleb
rested
in
one
of
the
desk
chairs
contemplating
his
next
move,
a
blaring
klaxon
sounded
throughout
the
building
and
red
alarm
lights
started
flashing.
What
did
they
do
now?
Pull
the
fire
alarm
to
flush
me
out?
Im
not
going
out
that
easily,
he
thought.
Suddenly
his
vision
clouded
and
felt
a
sharp
pain
coming
from
the
back
of
his
head.
Nerve
agents
now?
But
I
saw
no
gas
His
thoughts
trailed
off
as
he
passed
out
and
his
head
fell
to
the
desk.
