At the end of Mists of Pandaria, Garrosh Hellscream is overthrown as Warchief of the Horde by a combined Alliance-Horde force and taken into custody by the Pandaren so that he can stand trial for the atrocities he committed in Pandaria. However, before he can be judged, Garrosh escapes captivity with the aid of a renegade bronze dragon, and travels to an alternate timeline, to the orcish homeworld of Draenor prior to the rise of the Horde. Once there, he prevents the orcish clans from drinking the blood of the demon lord Mannoroth, which led to their corruption by the Burning Legion and played a major role in the events of the first three games. The clans unite into an "Iron Horde", using technology Garrosh brought from his reality, and begin a war of conquest on Draenor, which also leads to the building of a Dark Portal that would allow them to travel through time and lay siege to the Azeroth of the present era
